# mini-PathTracer
simple path-tracer to use in some of my cloud auto-scale illustrations  

It mainly follows the approach illustrated by Peter Shirley in his RayTracing series [Ray Tracing in one weekend](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5AODD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01B5AODD8&linkCode=as2&tag=inonwe09-20&linkId=OPNJXXJY2IBCMEGE) and its continuation.

This PathTracer will also represent a starting point and a test filed for different experiments basend on [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321399528/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321399528&linkCode=as2&tag=inonwe09-20&linkId=HQRNNI5TVG2IVRMT) book.
